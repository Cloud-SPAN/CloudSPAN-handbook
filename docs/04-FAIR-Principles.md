# FAIR Principles

## What is FAIR data?

FAIR data is **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable** and **Reusable**.
</div>
These principles are designed to help both humans and machines find and reuse data as easily as possible. They are aspirational but tangible steps can be made towards realising them.

You can read about the ethical values underlying the FAIR principles via the FAIR Cookbook [here](https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/recipes/introduction/FAIRplus-values.html).

### Findable {-}
**Findable** is all about making sure data/resources are as easy to find as possible.

How we're making resources **findable** at Cloud-SPAN:

- We will be assigning persistent identifiers to our teaching materials to prevent "link rot", or broken links.
- We will register our teaching materials with an appropriate registry (e.g. Carpentries Incubator), so they areeasier to find.
- We will be describing all our resources with rich metadata so they can be aggregated by the right registries.

### Accessible {-}
**Accessible** means it is easy to find out how to access the data/resources.

How we're making resources **accessible** at Cloud-SPAN:

- Our resources will be openly available, with no caveats, for use by those who cannot attend our workshops or who prefer self-led study.

### Interoperable {-}
**Interoperable** means data/resources can be easily integrated with other data/resources, and be viewable in different programs, applications or workflows.

How we're making resources **interoperable** at CLOUD-SPAN:

- We will supply data which is readable across different programs
- We are providing resources in Markdown, meaning they should display in most browsers.

### Reusable {-}
**Reusable** is about making sure that data/resources are suitable for re-use in different settings.

How we're making resources **reusable** at CLOUD-SPAN:

- We will be applying Creative Commons licenses to our resources so they can be reused and remixed by others.
- We welcome (and encourage!) outside contributions of explanations and examples - see the [Ways to contribute] for more information.
