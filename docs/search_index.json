As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level. Everyone who participates in CloudSPAN project activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the CloudSPAN project including, but not limited to, in person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub. By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the project core development team resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information. 2.2 Our Code of Conduct We are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines: Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Use welcoming and inclusive language. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants. Do not harass people. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact (see below for an extended list of behaviours we consider to be harassment). Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuousnot implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so. Respect the privacy and safety of others. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participants personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (doxing) is a form of harassment. Be considerate of others participation. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking. Dont be a bystander. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you dont feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support. As an overriding general rule, please be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. See this explanation of the four social rules - no feigning surprise, no well-actuallys, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours. 2.2.1 Unacceptable Behaviour Examples of unacceptable behaviour by community members at any project event or platform include: written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation violent threats or language directed against another person the display of sexual or violent images unwelcome sexual attention nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact sustained disruption of talks, events or communications insults or put downs sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes excessive swearing incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop publication of private communication without consent CloudSPAN prioritizes marginalized peoples safety over privileged peoples comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding: Reverse -isms, including reverse racism, reverse sexism, and cisphobia. Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as leave me alone, go away, or Im not discussing this with you. Communicating in a tone you dont find congenial. Criticism of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions. 2.3 Acknowledgements This Code was adapted from the Turing Way Code of Conduct, which itself draws from the Carpentries and Alan Turing Institute Data Study Group codes of conduct.

"],["the-cloud-span-commmunity.html", "Chapter 3 The Cloud-SPAN commmunity 3.1 Ways to contribute 3.2 Using GitHub to contribute", " Chapter 3 The Cloud-SPAN commmunity  Under construction  Our aim is to build a friendly and involved community of people who have used our resources, are interested in our resources, or who have expertise in the areas we cover. That means that whether you are  an expert in omics analyses  a complete newbie at omics  not entirely sure what an omic is  an experienced Cloud user  a little bewildered by the Cloud then the Cloud-SPAN community is for you! There are lots of ways to contribute and we welcome all of them! Contributing, and joining our community, doesnt have to mean writing technical code. Here are some ideas of ways you can contribute: 3.1 Ways to contribute Learn Attend or work through our Foundations in Genomics course. Ask questions on our community forum. Connect Join our Community of Practice. Help Answer questions on our community forum. Tell us about bugs or problems you encounter in the course. Expand Suggest new/different software tools for analysis. Contribute new examples. Attend one of our Train the Trainer courses so you can take parts of the course back to teach at your home institution. 3.2 Using GitHub to contribute We use GitHub as a tool for managing version control (AKA keeping a record of the projects development). This helps us stay accountable and transparent. Its also one of the ways we are making steps towards adhering to the FAIR Principles. If you want to contribute any content such as an update to the course or a new example then via GitHub is the best place to get in contact. For lots more guidance about how to contribute via GitHub, read our GitHub Contribution Guide. Git (the programming language underlying Github) and Github can be a little intimidating at first but dont worry, the team are here to hold your hand!  "],["fair-principles.html", "Chapter 4 FAIR Principles 4.1 What is FAIR data?", " Chapter 4 FAIR Principles 4.1 What is FAIR data? div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;} FAIR data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. These principles are designed to help both humans and machines find and reuse data as easily as possible. They are aspirational but tangible steps can be made towards realising them. You can read about the ethical values underlying the FAIR principles via the FAIR Cookbook here. Findable Findable is all about making sure data/resources are as easy to find as possible. How were making resources findable at Cloud-SPAN: We will be assigning persistent identifiers to our teaching materials to prevent link rot, or broken links. We will register our teaching materials with an appropriate registry (e.g.Â Carpentries Incubator), so they areeasier to find. We will be describing all our resources with rich metadata so they can be aggregated by the right registries. Accessible Accessible means it is easy to find out how to access the data/resources. How were making resources accessible at Cloud-SPAN: Our resources will be openly available, with no caveats, for use by those who cannot attend our workshops or who prefer self-led study. Interoperable Interoperable means data/resources can be easily integrated with other data/resources, and be viewable in different programs, applications or workflows. How were making resources interoperable at CLOUD-SPAN: We will supply data which is readable across differeny programs We are providing resources in Markdown, meaning they should dislay in most browsers. Reusable Reusable is about making sure that data/resources are suitable for re-use in different settings. How were making resources reusable at CLOUD-SPAN: We will be applying Creative Commons licenses to our resources so they can be reused and remixed by others. We welcome (and encourage!) outside contributions of explanations and examples - see the [Contributing Guide] for more information. "]]
