From the Node.js [base contribution policy](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951):

"The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:
- Encourages new contributions.
- Encourages contributors to remain involved.
- Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.
- Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how contributors can be involved in decision making."

and

"Creating barriers to entry just reduces the number of people there‚Äôs a chance to identify, educate and potentially grow into greater contributors."

### Using Github to contribute
We use Github as a tool for managing version control (AKA keeping a record of the project's development). This helps us stay accountable and transparent. It's also one of the ways we are making steps towards sticking to the [FAIR Principles].

Git (the programming language underlying Github) and Github can be a little intimidating at first but don't worry, the team are here to hold your hand ü§ù

Whether you have something to contribute, a question to ask or a suggestion to make, the first thing you should do is [open an issue]("https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues"). This keeps us up to date with any changes you're thinking about and helps prevent unnecessary conflict between versions.
