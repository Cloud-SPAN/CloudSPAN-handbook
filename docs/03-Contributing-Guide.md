# Contributing Guide
⚠️ **Under construction** ⚠️

From the Node.js [base contribution policy](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951):

"The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:
- Encourages new contributions.
- Encourages contributors to remain involved.
- Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.
- Creates a transparent decision making process which makes it clear how contributors can be involved in decision making."

and

"Creating barriers to entry just reduces the number of people there’s a chance to identify, educate and potentially grow into greater contributors."
