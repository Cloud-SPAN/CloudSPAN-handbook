# Our Courses {#courses}

Our courses provide a thorough and well-paced introduction to the use of cloud computing resources (via Amazon Web Services) for genomic analysis.

We currently offer two foundational courses ([Prenomics](#prenomics) and [Genomics](#genomics)) and are developing further courses on topics such as launching your own cloud instance and metagenomic analysis. A full learning path will be revealed soon.

All of our courses are offered **free of charge**.

## Prenomics Course {#prenomics}
['Prenomics'](https://cloud-span.github.io/prenomics00-intro/) is an interactive online course on understanding file systems and using the command line which takes place over 2 half days (roughly six hours of content). We developed this course after finding that people taking the Genomics course vary in their experiencing of navigating file systems and the command line (shell).

Topics covered include file directory structure, logging onto a cloud instance, basic shell commands and using the shell to manipulate and search files.

NO prior experience is necessary.

This course will next run in mid-November. However, all training resources remain [available online for self-study purposes](https://cloud-span.github.io/prenomics00-intro/).

Next course dates:  
ðŸ“† Tue 15th November, 10am-1pm  
ðŸ“† Weds 16th November, 10am-1pm  

## Genomics Course {#genomics}
['Genomics'](https://cloud-span.github.io/00genomics/) is a practical, tutor-led course taking place over 4 half days or 2 full days (roughly twelve hours of content). It teaches data management and analytical skills using cloud resources for genomic research. Previously it has been held online due to Covid-19 but the next Genomics course will be held in-person.

Topics covered include project management for cloud genomics, writing shell scripts, automating workflows, assessing read quality, trimming/filtering reads and finding sequence variants.

A basic knowledge of the shell is required, which can be obtained by attending/self-studying the Prenomics course.

This course will next run in mid-November. However, all training resources remain [available online for self-study purposes](https://cloud-span.github.io/00genomics/).

Next course dates:  
ðŸ“† Tues 22nd November, 9:30am-4:30pm  
ðŸ“† Weds 23rd November, 9:30am-4:30pm  

## Future Courses
### Create your own AWS instance
This mostly online course will be on [creating and managing an Amazon Web Service instance(https://cloud-span.github.io/create-aws-instance-0-overview/), intended to guide participants through the process of setting launching their own cloud instance in order to:

- study course materials further
- perform more complex analyses on their own data.

### Metagenomics
This mostly online course will focus on analysis methods and tools used in metagenomics.
