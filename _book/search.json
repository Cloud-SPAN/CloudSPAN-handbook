This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Cloud-SPAN project including, but not limited to, in person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.

    "text": "Our Code of Conduct\nWe are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:\n\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.\nUse welcoming and inclusive language. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.\nDo not harass people. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact (see below for an extended list of behaviours we consider to be harassment). Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.\nRespect the privacy and safety of others. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participant’s personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (“doxing”) is a form of harassment.\nBe considerate of others’ participation. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.\nDon’t be a bystander. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.\n\n\nUnacceptable Behaviour\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour by community members at any project event or platform include:\n\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation\nviolent threats or language directed against another person\nthe display of sexual or violent images\nunwelcome sexual attention\nnonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications\ninsults or put downs\nsexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes\nexcessive swearing\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop\npublication of private communication without consent\n\nCloudSPAN prioritises marginalised people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:\n\n‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’.\nReasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”\nCommunicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial.\nCriticism of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.",
