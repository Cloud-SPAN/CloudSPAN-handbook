    "text": "3.2 Our Code of Conduct\nWe are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:\n\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.\nUse welcoming and inclusive language. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.\nDo not harass people. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact (see below for an extended list of behaviours we consider to be harassment). Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous‚Äînot implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.\nRespect the privacy and safety of others. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participant‚Äôs personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (‚Äúdoxing‚Äù) is a form of harassment.\nBe considerate of others‚Äô participation. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.\nDon‚Äôt be a bystander. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.\nAs an overriding general rule, please be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes.\n\nAll interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. See this explanation of the four social rules - no feigning surprise, no well-actually‚Äôs, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.\n\n3.2.1 Unacceptable Behaviour\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour by community members at any project event or platform include:\n\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation\nviolent threats or language directed against another person\nthe display of sexual or violent images\nunwelcome sexual attention\nnonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications\ninsults or put downs\nsexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes\nexcessive swearing\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop\npublication of private communication without consent\n\nCloudSPAN prioritises marginalised people‚Äôs safety over privileged people‚Äôs comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:\n\n‚ÄòReverse‚Äô -isms, including ‚Äòreverse racism,‚Äô ‚Äòreverse sexism,‚Äô and ‚Äòcisphobia‚Äô.\nReasonable communication of boundaries, such as ‚Äúleave me alone,‚Äù ‚Äúgo away,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not discussing this with you.‚Äù\nCommunicating in a ‚Äòtone‚Äô you don‚Äôt find congenial.\nCriticism of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.",
